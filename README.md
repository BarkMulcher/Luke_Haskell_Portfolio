Portfolio Project
---------------------

The goal of this project is to create a website from scratch that will showcase our projects and web developement capabilities, as well as iform the reader a little about ourselves. It will act as a first impression for a potential employer or instructor, to gauge our proficiency, even before reviewing our resume or speaking to us.

I was really looking forward to seeing how I could put to use the material I have learned so far.
