# Portfolio Project

## A showcase of my choicest products. It is for employers or future teammates to learn a little about me, to and contact me.
---------------------

### The goal of this project is to create a website from scratch that will showcase our projects and web developement capabilities, as well as iform the reader a little about ourselves. It will act as a first impression for a potential employer or instructor, to gauge our proficiency, even before reviewing our resume or speaking to us.

### I was really looking forward to seeing how I could put to use the material I have learned so far. 

--------------------------------------

### Starting out the website was the easiest part, laying out the basic HTML format, and starting to shape the header and nav elements with CSS.

### The difficulty increased as I progressed through the page, because I didn't want a basic-looking site. I wanted something polished - as close as possible to the neatness of the example .gif. It was really important to me that I not only put forth my best effort for my grade, but also that the site look as close to my vision as possible. Getting this project to that point presented me with many struggles, the solutions to some were ...embarrassing. Other issues were solved by reading additional online resources. 

### My first struggle was shaping my nav links to look cool, accomplished with flex display properties.

### I also spent quite a long time making header and body background images look as desired. This involved me learning a lot about CSS display properties! I believe I made considerable progress in my knowledge in this portion. They were my own photos, and I was being very particular about their alignment - perhaps too much so. 

### Under the section for "My Work", I could only display the two items I have created so far -- Module 1 & 2 projects. And, while I did have the desire for more creative "placeholder" images, I simply ran out of time to do so. In hindsight, I wish I had moved on from imperfect background images.

### In the contact section, I created the responsive link elements several times before getting them to align how I wanted, and to respond correctly to window resizing.  

### I ran into a real sticky, stressful mess when I went to live-deploy my page through github pages on the due date -- none of my inline HTML images were loading, at all! All images sourced with CSS load fine. At the time of writing, only my "About Me" image had loaded. At first, I thought it was due to a file path problem, as outlined on several stackoverflow threads and other sites. But I now think that there is a long delay with github deployment pages due to bandwidth concerns. In case the images don't load for the grader, my screenshot shows that they load from my HTML file. 

### Anyhow, I hope that by the time of grading, the "My Work" section shows images.

### *I will be updating this readme.md to be a more streamlined, professional read after grading.*
