Portfolio Project
---------------------

The goal of this project is to create a website from scratch that will showcase our projects and web developement capabilities, as well as iform the reader a little about ourselves. It will act as a first impression for a potential employer or instructor, to gauge our proficiency, even before reviewing our resume or speaking to us.

I was really looking forward to seeing how I could put to use the material I have learned so far. 

--------------------------------------

Starting out the website was the easiest part, laying out the basic HTML format, and starting to shape the header and nav elements with CSS.

The difficulty increased as I progressed through the page, where I didn't just want to have an incredibly basic site. It was really important to me that I not only put forth my best effort for my grade, but also that the site look as close to my vision as possible. Getting this project to that point presented me with many struggles, the solutions to some were embarrassingly simple. Other issues were simply solved by reading additional online resources. 

My first struggle was making my nav links look acceptable, which I accomplished with flex display properties, for my own practice.

I also spent quite a long time fiddling with making a photo into a background image for the header. It was my own photo, and I was being very particular about its alignment - perhaps too much so. Making matters worse, I spent a great deal of time figuring out why images weren't loading, ultimately learning how to correctly insert a path into HTML - something I hadn't had issues with before, but something to do with the root directory being different for this project...
