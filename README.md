# Portfolio Project
---------------------
## Description:
### A showcase of my choicest products. It is for employers or future teammates to learn a little about me, and to contact me.

### The goal of this project is to create a website from scratch that will showcase our projects and web developement capabilities, as well as iform the reader a little about ourselves. It will act as a first impression for a potential employer or instructor, to gauge our proficiency, even before reviewing our resume or speaking to us.
