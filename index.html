            </h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Lucas Haskell. I have begun a new career path into the exciting world of web development.<br>
                I will quickly become proficient in the role of a full-stack developer, as I have a high level of motivation.<br>
                for success. I grew up in eastern Maine, and spent some time in the US Army. I have traveled all around the <br>
                world, and I believe that bringing that experience and perspective to the workplace is of great benefit. I  <br>
                lived in Portland, Oregon for twelve years, working in the semiconductor manufacturing field. This industry evolves <br>
                at a blistering pace, utilizing the most cutting-edge technology in existence to outperform competition. My  <br>
                experience in that world is what led me to continue my personal growth in this arena of the tech sector. <br>
                The dedication required in that sector remains with me today, and will shine through the continuous improvement <br>
                of my new craft.
