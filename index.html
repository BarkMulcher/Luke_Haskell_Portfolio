                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Lucas Haskell. I have begun a career in the exciting world of web development.
                        I will quickly become proficient in the role of a full-stack developer, as I have a high level of motivation.
                        for success. During and after some time in the military, I traveled all around the 
                        world, and I believe that experience and perspective is of great benefit. I  
                        lived in Portland, Oregon for twelve years, working in the semiconductor manufacturing field. This industry evolves 
                        at a blistering pace, utilizing the most cutting-edge technology in existence to outperform competition. My  
                        experience in that world is what led me to continue my personal growth in this arena of the tech sector. 
                        The dedication required in that role remains with me today, and will shine through the continuous improvement
                        of my new craft.
                    </p>

                        I am becoming proficient in several languages for both web & software development.
